# Developing Data Products Week 04 Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch
**Instructions:** This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

### Project Information
**Wikipedia Historical Figures Application and Presentation**: I thought it would be interesting to visualize some of the qualitative information from this dataset, so I created a Shiny app with a presentation to pitch why it's interesting and why you should be interested in such a thing.


### Citations
* I obtained the dataset from the Pantheon Project: Historical Popularity Index on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).  See the dataset and open project information here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products/peer/tMYrn/course-project-shiny-application-and-reproducible-pitch
